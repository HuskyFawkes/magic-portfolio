## Overview

Banco BTG set out to enhance the loan application experience by developing a more intuitive and streamlined digital 
process. The project focused on reducing friction in form-filling, improving transparency in loan conditions, and 
ensuring users could complete their applications with confidence. 

The goal was to create a seamless, accessible, 
and efficient loan process that catered to diverse financial needs.

## User Research & Key Insights

To understand pain points and opportunities in the loan application journey, we conducted qualitative interviews and usability testing with potential borrowers. Key insights included:

    Scenario 1: The First-Time Borrower
    "I’ve never applied for a loan before, and I don’t understand the requirements."
    → The new design prioritized clear explanations and tooltips to guide users step by step.

    Scenario 2: The Time-Sensitive Applicant
    "I need a loan urgently, but the process feels too long and confusing."
    → We optimized form fields, introduced autofill capabilities, and minimized redundant steps.

    Scenario 3: The Rate-Conscious User
    "I want to compare loan rates before committing, but the information isn’t clear."
    → We redesigned the loan conditions page to provide transparent, upfront comparisons.
