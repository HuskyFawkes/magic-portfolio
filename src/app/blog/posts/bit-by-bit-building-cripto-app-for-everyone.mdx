Welcome to the first edition of my **Bit by Bit Development Updates**! As part of my portfolio, I’m excited to share the journey of designing *Bit by Bit*, a mobile app aimed at making cryptocurrency payments accessible to novices, especially in Brazil. This project is the heart of my college thesis, and through this newsletter, I’ll document my process, from research to launch. Let’s dive into the first phase: **User Research**.

# Why Bit by Bit?

Cryptocurrency is booming in Brazil, with over 10% of adults owning crypto by 2024. Yet, for beginners, the complexity of wallets, exchanges, and transactions is a major barrier. *Bit by Bit* seeks to simplify this, offering an intuitive app for sending and receiving crypto via QR codes, paired with educational resources to build confidence.

My goal? Create a user-centered experience that feels as easy as sending a bank transfer, tailored to Brazil’s unique financial landscape.

## Research Phase: Understanding the User

To design for novices, I started with user research. Here’s what I did:

- **Interviews**: Spoke with 15 Brazilians (ages 18–35) new to crypto to understand their fears and needs. Key insight: Most felt overwhelmed by technical jargon and security concerns.
- **Surveys**: Collected data from 50 respondents via Google Forms, revealing that 70% wanted a “guided” onboarding process.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Studied apps like Mercado Bitcoin and Binance, noting their strengths (e.g., robust security) and gaps (e.g., lack of beginner-friendly tutorials).

One persona emerged: *Lucas, 25*, a freelancer who wants to accept crypto payments but finds current apps intimidating. My challenge is to make *Bit by Bit* feel safe, simple, and empowering for users like Lucas.

## What I Learned

- **Clarity is King**: Users need clear, jargon-free explanations of crypto concepts.
- **Trust Matters**: Security features (like two-factor authentication) must be prominent but not overwhelming.
- **Education Drives Adoption**: In-app tutorials or tips can bridge the knowledge gap for novices.

## Next Steps

I’m now moving into wireframing, where I’ll design the QR code payment flow and onboarding screens. My focus is on creating a clean, intuitive interface that feels familiar to mobile banking users. Stay tuned for the next update, where I’ll share my first sketches and get feedback from test users!

### Leveraging AI for MVP Development

To accelerate development and test my concepts, I’m exploring AI tools to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of *Bit by Bit*. Here’s my plan:

- **Loveable for App Development**: I’ll use Loveable, an AI-powered platform, to generate a functional prototype of the app based on my current interface designs. This will allow me to test core features, like QR code payments, in a real-world setting while keeping development lean.
- **Readdy AI for Landing Pages**: To promote the MVP and gather early user feedback, I’ll use Readdy AI to create landing pages (LPs) showcasing *Bit by Bit*’s value proposition. These pages will target Brazilian freelancers and small business owners, emphasizing simplicity and security.
- **Parallel UX Research**: While testing the AI-generated MVP, I’ll continue refining the interface in Figma based on ongoing user research. This dual approach lets me validate the current design quickly via the MVP while iterating on a more polished version for future releases.

My main goal is to evaluate how AI tools can streamline MVP development for a crypto app, balancing speed with quality. By testing Loveable and Readdy AI, I aim to learn their strengths and limitations, which will inform my thesis and future design projects.

Stay tuned for the next update, where I’ll share my wireframes, early MVP results, and insights from experimenting with AI tools!
