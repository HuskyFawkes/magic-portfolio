## Overview

In this project, I focused on automating the often tedious design handover process. The goal was to create a pipeline that converts Figma designs directly into clean, production-ready code. By integrating design tokens, component libraries, and automated workflows, this solution significantly reduced the time spent on translating design assets into code, while maintaining design consistency across the product.

## Key Features

- **Pre-Order & Pick-Up**: Users can order their favorite drinks in advance, reducing wait times.
- **Table Reservations**: The ability to secure a spot in their favorite caf√© for a more relaxed experience.
- **Personalized Coffee Recommendations**: Smart suggestions based on user preferences.
- **Seamless Caf√© Integration**: An intuitive interface that connects customers with participating coffee shops.
- **User-Centric Design**: A polished and accessible UI, crafted based on thorough research and testing.

## Technologies Used

  - **Figma**: For UI/UX design, prototyping, and creating a structured design system.
  - **Notion**: For organizing research insights, project documentation, and task management.
  - **Canva**: For creating marketing assets and presentation materials to showcase the project.
  - **Maze**:  For conducting usability testing and gathering real user feedback to refine interactions.
  
## Research
A strong research foundation is key to any successful project. Our approach involves an in-depth study of 
different aspects of the problem to ensure well-founded and effective solutions.

üìå Personas

Understanding users is essential for creating relevant experiences. We develop detailed personas to represent different user profiles, identifying their needs, challenges, and expectations.

üåç Context

We analyze the environment in which the product will be used, considering factors such as user behavior, technological limitations, and external conditions that may influence the experience.
üìä Market Analysis

We study trends, competitors, and opportunities to ensure our product aligns with market needs and stands out in the competitive landscape.
üîé CSD Matrix

We use the CSD Matrix (Certainties, Suppositions, and Doubts) to structure our research and define the key questions that guide the project‚Äôs development.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges in designing Caf√© Jetiboca was creating an intuitive and frictionless 
experience for users who wanted to order coffee ahead of time or reserve a spot in their 
favorite caf√©s. 


Balancing a streamlined ordering process with the need for customization 
options‚Äîsuch as drink preferences and pick-up scheduling‚Äîrequired careful UX considerations. 
Additionally, ensuring seamless communication between users and coffee shops meant optimizing 
backend interactions and designing clear, real-time status updates. 


Iterative prototyping and 
user testing were essential in refining these aspects, leading to a more efficient and 
enjoyable experience.

## Outcome

Caf√© Jetiboca successfully bridges the gap between coffee lovers and their favorite 
caf√©s, offering a smooth and connected experience. 

Users can now conveniently 
order coffee in advance, reducing wait times and enhancing their daily routine. 
The app has also provided caf√©s with an efficient system for managing pre-orders 
and reservations, leading to increased customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.


By focusing on user experience and business needs, Caf√© Jetiboca creates value for both 
customers and coffee shops, redefining how people engage with their favorite coffee spots.
