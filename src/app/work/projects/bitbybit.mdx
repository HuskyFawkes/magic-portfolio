## Overview

**Bit by Bit** is a cryptocurrency payment app I developed as my college thesis to tackle the usability challenges faced by novice crypto users in Brazil. 

With over **1.6 million CPF/CNPJ registrations** for cryptocurrency purchases in Q1 2023 alone (according to the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service), digital currencies are gaining traction. 

  Yet, their practical use as a payment method remains limited—few merchants actively accept them, and existing platforms like PicPay often overwhelm beginners with complex, market-focused interfaces.

Motivated by this gap, I set out to design an app that simplifies crypto transactions for everyday use, guided by **Donald Norman’s principles of intuitive design**. Targeting novices and casual crypto holders, Bit by Bit focuses solely on facilitating payments between users and merchants, leveraging **QR codes** and **NFC technology** for seamless, modern transactions.

## User Research & Key Insights

To ensure the design met real user needs, I conducted a multi-faceted research process:

- **Bibliographic Research**: Explored secondary sources, including cryptocurrency studies and design theory (e.g., Ulrich, Boff & Ferreira).
- **Competitive Analysis**: Evaluated platforms like PicPay, identifying their complexity and trader-centric features as barriers for novices.
- **Data Analysis**: Drew on public data, such as Receita Federal’s registration stats and Coinmap heatmaps (2013–2023), which showed limited merchant adoption despite growing user interest.

### Key Findings:
- **Complexity Barrier**: Most crypto platforms cater to traders, not everyday users, with cluttered interfaces that deter novices.
- **Adoption vs. Use Gap**: While adoption is soaring, practical use lags—e.g., a Câmara study found only 6 out of 20 businesses had completed a crypto transaction.
- **User Needs**: Novices crave a simplified, transaction-focused tool that builds confidence without overwhelming them.

These insights drove the app’s focus: strip away market features and prioritize seamless payments.

## Technologies Used

While specific development tools are still being finalized, the project leverages:

- **Figma**: For wireframing, prototyping, and crafting the UI.
- **Blockchain Research**: Explored user-friendly implementations on networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
- **Design Tools**: Used to create intuitive interfaces and streamlined user flows.

## Design Process

The app’s development follows a **user-centered design (UCD)** approach, rooted in iterative refinement and Norman’s usability principles:

1. **Research Phase**: Conducted bibliographic studies and analyzed existing platforms to pinpoint pain points.
2. **Wireframing**: Sketched initial layouts prioritizing simple transaction flows.
3. **Prototyping**: Built high-fidelity prototypes in Figma with a clean, minimalist aesthetic.
4. **Usability Testing (Planned)**: Will test with novice users to ensure the app’s intuitiveness, scheduled for late 2023.

### Challenges and Solutions:
- **Challenge**: Simplifying blockchain’s complexity for novices.  
  → **Solution**: Added contextual learning (e.g., pop-up tips) to educate users in the moment.
- **Challenge**: Balancing security with ease of use.  
  → **Solution**: Employed progressive disclosure to reveal security details only when needed.

## Outcome

As a thesis project spanning **February to December 2023**, Bit by Bit is still in progress. Anticipated outcomes include:

- **Increased User Confidence**: Simplified design and educational tools will empower novices to use crypto comfortably.
- **Higher Transaction Success**: Streamlined flows and real-time feedback will minimize errors and drop-offs.
- **Academic Impact**: The project will showcase how service design can boost technology adoption, contributing to UX research in fintech.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Simplicity vs. Education**: I learned to weave learning into the experience subtly, using contextual cues instead of heavy tutorials.
- **Building Trust**: Security features were integrated thoughtfully to reassure users without adding friction.
- **Iterative Design**: Early (simulated) feedback underscored the need for clearer transaction feedback, prompting UI tweaks.

## Future Work

Looking ahead, potential enhancements include:
- Support for **multiple cryptocurrencies** to broaden appeal.
- Integration with **traditional payment systems** for greater flexibility.
- Expanded **educational modules**, possibly gamified, to deepen user engagement.
