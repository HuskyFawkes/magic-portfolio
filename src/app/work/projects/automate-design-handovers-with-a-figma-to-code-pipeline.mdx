## Overview

In this project, I focused on automating the often tedious design handover process. The goal was to create a pipeline that converts Figma designs directly into clean, production-ready code. By integrating design tokens, component libraries, and automated workflows, this solution significantly reduced the time spent on translating design assets into code, while maintaining design consistency across the product.

## Key Features

- **Figma Plugin Integration**: Developed a custom Figma plugin that extracts design tokens such as colors, typography, and spacing values, and exports them in a format compatible with our codebase.
- **Code Generation**: Integrated an automated process that translates Figma components into React code using a combination of design tokens and pre-built component templates. This allowed developers to focus more on logic and less on repetitive UI coding.
- **Continuous Sync**: Established a CI/CD pipeline that continuously synchronizes design changes from Figma to the codebase, ensuring design updates are reflected instantly without manual intervention.
- **Scalable Design System**: Leveraged a design system that remains the single source of truth for both designers and developers, making it easy to maintain consistency even as the product evolves.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma API**: For extracting design tokens and component data directly from the Figma designs.
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Styled-Components**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge in designing the HR management and testing platform was ensuring an intuitive user experience while handling 
complex workflows. The need to accommodate different HR processes without overwhelming users required a careful balance 
between flexibility and simplicity. The solution involved iterative user testing and refining navigation 
patterns to enhance usability. Additionally, improving collaboration between design and development teams 
through Figma and component-based design approaches helped streamline implementation.

## Outcome

The design system is now actively used across multiple projects, leading to faster development cycles, 
fewer design inconsistencies, and improved collaboration between design and development teams. 
It has become a foundation for scaling our products efficiently while ensuring a cohesive user experience.
