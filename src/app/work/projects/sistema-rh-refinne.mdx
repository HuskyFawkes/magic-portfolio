## Overview

I designed a comprehensive HR software solution that enables companies to track and manage collaborators 
through structured testing and evaluation. 

The platform provides an intuitive dashboard that 
allows HR professionals to oversee project statuses, analyze collaborator performance, 
and manage various administrative tasks efficiently.
## Key Features

- **Project Tracking**: Visual insights into ongoing, completed, and archived HR initiatives..
- **Collaborator Management**: Centralized database for employee records and performance tracking.
- **Automated Testing & Assessments**:  Seamless test creation and evaluation workflows.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and heatmaps for real-time project analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and structured UI for an enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Miro**: For planning, information architecture and user flow.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Loom**: For recording and video documentation.
- **Notion**: For overwall documentation.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing the need for flexibility with the desire to 
maintain design consistency. 


The solution involved creating well-defined design 
tokens and establishing clear guidelines for when and how components could be 
customized. 


Additionally, setting up effective collaboration workflows between designers 
and developers using Figma and Git was a learning experience that greatly 
improved the process.

## Outcome

The design system is now actively used across multiple projects, leading to faster development cycles, fewer design inconsistencies, and improved collaboration between design and development teams. It has become a foundation for scaling our products efficiently while ensuring a cohesive user experience.
