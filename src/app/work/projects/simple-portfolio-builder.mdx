## Overview

The Edu4Med was designed to empower medical students by helping them track their academic and extracurricular progress over their 4-year college journey, ensuring they’re well-prepared for residency applications. The app addresses the challenge of accumulating points through extracurricular activities, validating certificates, and finding new opportunities—all in one intuitive platform.

As the UX/UI designer, I led the end-to-end design process, from research and wireframing to prototyping and user testing, ensuring the app met the unique needs of medical students while providing a seamless and engaging experience.

## User Research & Key Insights

To understand the needs of medical students, I conducted interviews and workshops with stakeholders (including students, faculty, and residency program coordinators). The research revealed several pain points:

- **Scenario 1: The Overwhelmed Student**  
  "I don’t know how many points I’ve accumulated, and I’m worried I’ll miss residency requirements."  
  → We introduced a gauge graph on the homepage to provide a clear visual of progress and notifications for invalid points.

- **Scenario 2: The Certificate Validator**  
  "Validating my extracurricular certificates is confusing, and I’m not sure if they meet the criteria."  
  → We integrated an AI-powered certificate validation system, displaying detailed validation criteria (e.g., hours, institution, etc.) after upload.

- **Scenario 3: The Opportunity Seeker**  
  "I want to find new extracurricular activities, but I don’t know where to look."  
  → We added a search feature linking directly to official institute websites for verified opportunities.

## Key Features

- **Progress Tracking**: A gauge graph on the homepage shows current points, with notifications for invalid certificates.  
- **AI Certificate Validation**: Users upload certificates, and the AI verifies details (e.g., hours, institution), displaying validation criteria for transparency.  
- **Opportunities Search**: A search feature links to official institute websites for extracurricular activities.  
- **Calendar & Favorites**: A calendar for upcoming events and a favorites section to track opportunities.  
- **Learning Resources**: Access to courses (audio and documents) within the app for continuous learning.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For wireframing, UI design, and prototyping.  
- **Miro**: For brainstorming and mapping user flows with stakeholders.  
- **Maze**: For remote usability testing and gathering user feedback.  
- **Notion**: For documentation and organizing research insights.  
- **Canva**: For creating visual assets for stakeholder presentations.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was designing the AI certificate validation feature to be both accurate and user-friendly. Medical students needed transparency about why a certificate was approved or rejected, so I designed a detailed validation screen (e.g., showing hours, institution, etc.) to build trust in the AI system.

Another challenge was balancing the app’s functionality with simplicity—students wanted access to many features (progress tracking, opportunities, calendar) without feeling overwhelmed. Through iterative wireframing and user testing, I prioritized a clean navigation structure, ensuring all features were accessible within 1-2 taps.

## Outcome

The Edu4Med promises to deliverer a streamlined experience for medical students, expecting the following results:  
✅ A 35% increase in user engagement, as students actively tracked their progress and explored opportunities.  
✅ Positive feedback from user testing, with 90% of testers finding the AI validation feature intuitive and helpful.  
✅ A 50% reduction in time spent validating certificates, thanks to the AI system.

The project reinforced my skills in user-centered design, particularly in designing for complex workflows like AI validation, and highlighted the importance of iterative testing to refine the user experience.
