## Overview

**CrIA** is a project under development that aims to create an artificial intelligence solution for teachers.

### Research

- **Interviews**: 20+ Zoom sessions with public school teachers in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio.
- **Surveys**: 50 responses via Google Forms, revealing 80% frustration with generic AI outputs.
