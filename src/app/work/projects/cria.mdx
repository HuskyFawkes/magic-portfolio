## Project Overview

This project focused on the **complete reimagining** of the previous version of our crIA product, which suffered from significant issues related to **usability**, interface, and overall user experience (UX). My role as Product Designer was to conduct the initial research, define the core problems, and propose a new solution that would generate real value for both the user and the organization [2].

The main goal was to **increase user satisfaction and retention** through improved information architecture and interaction flows.

### Research
We conducted interviews, surveys, and competitive audits to understand teacher needs:
- **Interviews**: 20+ Zoom sessions with public school teachers in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio.
- **Surveys**: 50 responses via Google Forms, revealing 80% frustration with generic AI outputs.

## 5. Lessons Learned and Reflection

Reflecting on what you learned allows recruiters to understand who you are as a designer [3, 5].

*   **Importance of Prototype Testing:** This project reinforced the critical importance of continuously testing prototypes to explore new design concepts and ensure they were viable solutions before committing to development effort [3].
*   **Navigating Constraints:** I learned to work effectively within technical restrictions (of the legacy system) and explain why certain elements *did not* make it into the final design, which is just as important as explaining what did [2, 3, 7].
*   **Skill Refinement:** This strengthened my ability to prioritize which design capabilities I want to display, ensuring the portfolio appeals to its "users" (Hiring Managers, Recruiters) [4].
